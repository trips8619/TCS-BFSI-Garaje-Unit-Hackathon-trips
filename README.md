# TCS-BFSI-Garaje-Unit-Hackathon-trips
Build a machine learning model using the German Credit dataset to predict loan applicant risk. Includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and analysis of key risk factors to support better credit decision-making.


### üìå Overview

The repository titled **TCS-BFSI-Garaje-Unit-Hackathon** presents a solution for **Problem Statement 1** of the TCS BFSI Hackathon. The project focuses on **credit risk classification** using the **German Credit Risk dataset**, a well-known dataset in financial analytics. The objective is to predict whether a loan applicant is a "good" or "bad" credit risk based on various attributes.

### üîç Dataset Details

- **Source**: The dataset is sourced from Kaggle

- **Description**: Each entry represents a person who has taken a credit from a bank. The dataset includes various attributes such as credit history, purpose, credit amount, employment status, and more. The target variable classifies individuals as good or bad credit risks.

### üß† Modeling Approach

The project employs several machine learning models to classify credit risk:

- **Decision Tree Classifier**: A tree-based model that splits the data based on feature values to make predictions.

- **Gradient Boosting Classifier**: An ensemble model that builds trees sequentially, each trying to correct the errors of the previous one.

- **XGBoost Classifier**: An optimized version of gradient boosting that is efficient and scalable.

- **LightGBM Classifier**: A gradient boosting framework that uses tree-based learning algorithms, known for its speed and efficiency.

The notebook likely includes data preprocessing steps such as handling categorical variables, missing values, and feature scaling, followed by model training and evaluation using appropriate metrics.

### üìà Evaluation Metrics

While specific metrics are not detailed in the provided information, typical evaluation metrics for classification tasks include:

- **Accuracy**: The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances.

- **Precision**: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positive observations.

- **Recall (Sensitivity)**: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all actual positive observations.

- **F1 Score**: The weighted average of Precision and Recall.

- **ROC-AUC Score**: Measures the model's ability to distinguish between classes.

### ‚úÖ Strengths

- **Comprehensive Modeling**: The use of multiple advanced machine learning models allows for comparative analysis and selection of the best-performing model.

- **Clear Documentation**: The `README.md` provides a concise overview, making it easier for users to understand the project's purpose and requirements.

- **Reproducibility**: Inclusion of the dataset and a `requirements.txt` file ensures that others can replicate the results.

### üîß Areas for Improvement

- **Model Evaluation Details**: Providing detailed evaluation metrics and visualizations (e.g., confusion matrix, ROC curves) would offer deeper insights into model performance.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Including hyperparameter tuning processes (e.g., GridSearchCV) could enhance model performance.

- **Cross-Validation**: Implementing cross-validation techniques would ensure the model's robustness and generalizability.

- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Analyzing and visualizing feature importance can help in understanding which features contribute most to the predictions.
